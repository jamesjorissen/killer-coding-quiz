# killer-coding-quiz

I couldn't get this one to work. I liked the html and css portions. I also liked the problems presented by the assignment. I just ran out of time. I will pick it back up soon and resubmit, hopefully your feedback will help. I thought I had found resources with code that I could use and implement that would work, but I couldn't quite get it to perform.

Thanks and good night.
